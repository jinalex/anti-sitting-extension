Anti-sitting-extension
======================

Now Available on the Chrome Store! https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-up-reminder-alpha/occnmkldimeeohichfkokhangifpbdgf

This is a Chrome extension which is intended to remind Chrome users to periodically get up from their seats and move about. This is an effort to combat sedentary behaviour. 

I was inspired to create this after hearing about the harmful effects of sedentary behaviour. This extension is also a means for me to learn more about web design and development. In particular this project was built around a Material Design theme.
